# Codius host

**NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**

This is a prototype implementation of a Codius host. Codius hosts run contracts and provide them with APIs that allow for key generation, interaction with outside systems and lots more! Please keep in mind that is an early prototype and it's still missing a lot of functionality for it to be secure, stable and useful.

## Installation

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/codius/codius-host.git
cd codius-host
npm install
npm link
codius-host start
```

## Now what?

To interact with your Codius host, checkout the [Codius CLI](https://github.com/codius/codius-cli).

# Setting up a local Codius host for testing

## Certificate

First, you need to generate a self-signed certificate. 

``` sh
npm run keygen
```

Which runs the following OpenSSL command to generate RSA keys:

``` sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```

## Hostname

In order to use a local Codius host, you need to redirect requests like abcabc-abcabc-abcabc.example.com to your local host. Unfortunately, `/etc/hosts` does not allow you to specify wildcard hosts.

On Ubuntu, an easy way to get around this problem is using `dnsmasq`.

``` sh
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
echo 'address=/localcodius/127.0.0.1' | sudo tee --append /etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```

Afterwards, configure your Codius host to use "localcodius" as its hostname. You'll be able to access local contracts using URLs like https://abcabc-abcabc-abcabc.localcodius:2633.

## Contributing

Development of features should made on the `master` branch behind a Feature Flag. To create a feaure flag require `lib/features.js` and only run your feature's code if the feature is enabed. Feature names are in ALL_CAPS.

````
var features = require('lib/features')

if (features.isEnabled('MY_COOL_FEATURE')) {
  // New code belongs here
}
````


Features are enabled at startup using the command line flag -f or --features. Multiple features can be specified using commas without spaces.

````
codius-host start --features my_cool_feature

codius-host start -f feature_one,feature_two
````
